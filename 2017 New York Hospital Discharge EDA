Patient zip code is limited to the first three digits. However, in cases where the population size for the zip code is less than 20,000, if the cell size on patient classification strata are less than 10, or if the record is an abortion then the zip code is blank. The code “OOS” indicates Out of State zip codes. Patient age is presented in age groups: 0 to 17, 18 to 29, 30 to 49, 50 to 69, and 70 or Older. For years beginning with 2011, the variable indicating the type of insurance expected to pay the discharge has changed. Originally it was the Source of Payment. Effective December 2015, it is now the Payment Typology\n\n\n\n\n#### **My Goal**\nmy goal is to do a patial Exploratory Data Analysis of the data and to figure out some points that can help in my primary task of creating a model that can predict the Length of stay of patients in the new york hospital Area.\n\n##### **How i do this**\n- The pipeline that i am trying is Ask a question and then Answer the question through visulalization\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.
