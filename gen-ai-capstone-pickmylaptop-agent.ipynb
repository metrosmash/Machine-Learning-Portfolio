It's designed to guide non-technical users through the laptop-buying journey — helping them make the right choice based on their **budget, preferences, and use case**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Innovation and Impact\n","\n","- **Conversational Intelligence**: Users can talk to the assistant in plain English, just like chatting with a tech-savvy friend.\n","- **Tool-Enhanced Gen AI**: Combines Gemini's advanced reasoning with:\n","  - **SQL tool access** to pull accurate laptop specs and prices.\n","- **Personalized Recommendations**: The assistant asks clarifying questions to tailor results — whether you're a student, a designer, a remote worker, or a casual user.\n","- **Data-Driven Answers Only**: It never makes things up — all suggestions are based strictly on what's found in the SQL database.\n","- **User-Centered Design**: Built to help those who aren't tech-savvy feel confident, informed, and supported in their purchase.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Real-World Use Potential\n","\n","This assistant can be deployed as:\n","- An in-store virtual sales rep.\n","- A chatbot on an e-commerce site.\n","- A personal tech advisor for family members who always ask *\"Which one should I buy?\"*\n","\n","By blending **accessibility**, **accuracy**, and **AI-powered guidance**, this project demonstrates how Gen AI can make technology more approachable — and shopping more human.\n","\n","### Gen AI Features Used\n","\n","- **Agents**: The assistant is built using Gemini Agents, which orchestrate reasoning and tool use in a structured, modular way — handling both SQL and vector search with custom tools.\n","- **Few-Shot Prompting**: Carefully crafted example interactions are provided to guide the model’s tone and logic, helping it give consistent and helpful responses.\n","- **Function Calling**: The assistant dynamically decides when to call specific tools (like querying the SQL database or retrieving from FAISS) based on the user's input — making it smart and responsive to real-time needs.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5669eaa2","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006616,"end_time":"2025-04-26T21:46:35.877811","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-04-26T21:46:35.871195","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
